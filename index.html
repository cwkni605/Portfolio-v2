                    <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p>My name is Connor Knight. I currently go to school at Liberty High school and West-MEC. I have taken every computer class that my school offers, including AP computer science. I like to program and make things. I have done cross country and long distance track every year of my high shool years. I have aided many of my now Eagle Scout friends with their Eagle Scout project. I have a small foundry and have melted aluminum into a more refined bar. I love computer programming with a passion and wish to continue learning as much as possible. I do not work outside of school yet.</p>
