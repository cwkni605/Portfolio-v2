                    Tanks are way better than cars. When you get into a crash you wont get hurt if you are in a tank. The other person who crashed into you though, that's
                    a different story. Although you should not even get into a crash because all of the cars are trying to avoid you. You dont ever have to deal with road 
                    raged people anymore. Just point the barrel at the car, not the person.

                <p class="fish">You can take your beautiful tank out to a nice grassy feild, aim the barrel, and shoot your neighbors house that you hate. You can have so many advantages in driving a tank.
                    The only disadvantage should be getting in and out. Speed dosen't matter get over it, ITS A FREAKING TANK.The price is around 2 million, very cheap!!
