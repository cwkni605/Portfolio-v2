                <div class="text">
                    <p>The Leopard 2A7 main battle tank was developed by
                         German Krauss-Maffei Wegmann in cooperation with 
                         the German Army. It is a proposed upgrade package 
                         for existing MBTs. It was first revealed in 2010. 
                         It is a further development of the Leopard 2A6 MBT. 
                         It includes some subsystems of the Leopard 2 Peace 
                         Support Operation variant. The Leopard 2A7 is intended 
                         for urban warfare, low intensity conflicts, as well as 
                         conventional military operations. Currently it is one 
                         of the best main battle tanks in the world. German 
                         Army plans to upgrade about 50-150 Leopard 2 tanks 
                         to the 2A7 standard. German Army ordered a first batch 
                         of 20 MBTs upgraded from existing German Army Leopard 
                         2A6 tanks. First Leopard 2A7 tanks were delivered 
                         to the German Army in 2014. This tank also received 
                         orders from export customers. In 2011 Germany agreed 
                         to sell more than 200 of these main battle tanks to 
                         Saudi Arabia. In 2013, Qatar ordered 62 of these MBTs.
                          These are known as Leopard 2A7Q. </p>
                        <p>
                            The Leopard 2A7 is a modular upgrade package, so other Leopard 2 tanks can be upgraded to this standard. Combat systems can be optimized depending on customer requirements.

                            Protection of this main battle tank was further improved.
                             The Leopard 2A7 is fitted with additional composite armor kit.
                              It is the latest generation of passive armor, which provides
                               higher level of protection against wide range of threats.
                                It seems that the armor uses new nano-ceramics materials
                                 and modern titanium and steel alloys. The new armor 
                                 offers 360Â° protection against RPG rounds. New side 
                                 skirts were fitted. Protection of the hull floor
                                  was also increased to withstand blasts for landmines 
                                  and improvised explosive devices. This MBT has a 
                            modular armor, so damaged modules can be easily 
                            replaced in field conditions.

                        This main battle tank is armed with a Rheinmetall
                         120 mm/L55 smoothbore gun. The same gun is used
                          on the Leopard 2A6. It has better fire accuracy
                           and longer range, comparing with the previous
                            Leopard 2 tanks. The gun is loaded manually 
                            and is compatible with all standard NATO ammunition,
                             as well as newly developed DM11 programmable 
                            HE rounds. These programmable multi-purpose
                           munitions enable to engage targets behind 
                           cover and within buildings. These rounds can 
                           be also used against enemy troops, armored 
                           vehicles and low-flying helicopters. A total
                            of 42 rounds are carried inside the tank. 
                            15 rounds are stored in the turret bustle 
                            and are ready to use. Remaining rounds are 
                            stored inside the hull.

                        Secondary armament consists of a 12.7 mm machine gun. It is mounted in remotely controlled weapon station on top of the roof. There is also a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun.

   This main battle tank has a front and rear thermal image system for the driver. Commander and gunner have additional cameras for long-range surveillance. Vehicle also carries advanced command and control equipment and is fitted with battlefield management system.

   The Leopard 2A7 is operated by a crew of four, including commander, gunner, loader and driver.

                        The Leopard 2A7 retains the engine of its predecessor.
                         It is powered by an MTU MB-837 Ka501 turbocharged diesel, 
                         developing 1 500 hp. This dated engine proved to be reliable 
                         and fuel efficient, but is bulky by modern standards. This MBT 
                         is also fitted with Steyr auxiliary power unit, which powers 
                         all systems, when the main engine is turned off. Despite increase 
                         in weight vehicle has increased mobility due to improved suspension 
                         components. Cross-country performance is similar to that of the 
                         2A5 and 2A6 tanks. This main battle tank can be fitted with a 
                         front-mounted dozer blade for self-entrenching and clearing 
                         obstacles. Mine ploughs or mine rollers can also be attached.
